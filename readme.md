# Python Pomodoro Timer

This app is a simple pomodoro timer for implementing the Pomodoro Method of productivity and time management. This popular time management method calls for setting timers with 2 distinct purposes: work sessons, short breaks. The idea is to focus on a task during a 25 minute sprint, then take a 5 minute break. 

I've found that this method works especially well when combined with a standup desk and pausing all notifications on devices. My protocol is as follows:

1. Set tasks for heads-down time
2. Complete a 25 minute focus-session
3. Take a 5 minute break for emails, texts, etc. Change desk state (standing if sitting, sitting if standing)
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until tasks have been completed
